        <p>
        2by2 is a double exposure photo app.<p> <br>
        It is a collaboration app that allows you to create double exposure images with friends (or with a random stranger).<br>
        You take a photo and it immediately goes to a waiting list where others can etch a second exposure over it. <br>
        Equally, you are presented with a feed of single exposure photos you can use as a base to etch a second exposure over them.<br>The results are always fun, unexpected and experimental. 
        </p>

        2by2 is made with love in NYC.
